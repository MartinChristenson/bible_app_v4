<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And this is the blessing, wherewith <span class="person">Moses </span>the man of God blessed the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>before his death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he said, The LORD came from <span class="place">Sinai</span>, and rose up from <span class="place">Seir </span>unto them; he shined forth from mount <span class="place">Paran</span>, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span><span class="person">Moses </span>commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of <span class="person">Jacob</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of <span class="place">Israel </span>were gathered together. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Let <span class="person">Reuben </span>live, and not die; and let not his men be few. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And this is the blessing of <span class="person">Judah</span>: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And of <span class="person">Levi </span>he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of <span class="place">Meribah</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>They shall teach <span class="person">Jacob </span>thy judgments, and <span class="place">Israel </span>thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And of <span class="person">Joseph </span>he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of <span class="person">Joseph</span>, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, and they are the thousands of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And of <span class="person">Zebulun </span>he said, Rejoice, <span class="person">Zebulun</span>, in thy going out; and, <span class="person">Issachar</span>, in thy tents. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And of <span class="person">Gad </span>he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth <span class="person">Gad</span>: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And of <span class="place">Dan </span>he said, <span class="place">Dan </span>is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And of <span class="person">Naphtali </span>he said, O <span class="person">Naphtali</span>, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And of <span class="person">Asher </span>he said, Let <span class="person">Asher </span>be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span><span class="place">Israel </span>then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of <span class="person">Jacob </span>shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Happy art thou, O <span class="place">Israel</span>: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.
