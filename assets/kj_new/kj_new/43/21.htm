<h3>Chapter 21 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>After these things <span class="person">Jesus </span>shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>There were together <span class="person">Simon </span><span class="person">Peter</span>, and <span class="person">Thomas </span>called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in <span class="place">Galilee</span>, and the sons of <span class="person">Zebedee</span>, and two other of his disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span><span class="person">Simon </span><span class="person">Peter </span>saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>But when the morning was now come, <span class="person">Jesus </span>stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Then <span class="person">Jesus </span>saith unto them, <span class="word">Children, have ye any meat? </span>They answered him, No. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And he said unto them, <span class="word">Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Therefore that disciple whom <span class="person">Jesus </span>loved saith unto <span class="person">Peter</span>, It is the Lord. Now when <span class="person">Simon </span><span class="person">Peter </span>heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span><span class="person">Jesus </span>saith unto them, <span class="word">Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span><span class="person">Simon </span><span class="person">Peter </span>went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span><span class="person">Jesus </span>saith unto them, <span class="word">Come and dine. </span>And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span><span class="person">Jesus </span>then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>This is now the third time that <span class="person">Jesus </span>shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>So when they had dined, <span class="person">Jesus </span>saith to <span class="person">Simon </span><span class="person">Peter</span>, <span class="word"><span class="person">Simon</span>, son of <span class="person">Jonas</span>, lovest thou me more than these? </span>He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class="word">Feed my lambs. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>He saith to him again the second time, <span class="word"><span class="person">Simon</span>, son of <span class="person">Jonas</span>, lovest thou me? </span>He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class="word">Feed my sheep. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>He saith unto him the third time, <span class="word"><span class="person">Simon</span>, son of <span class="person">Jonas</span>, lovest thou me? </span><span class="person">Peter </span>was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. <span class="person">Jesus </span>saith unto him, <span class="word">Feed my sheep. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span><span class="word">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, <span class="word">Follow me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Then <span class="person">Peter</span>, turning about, seeth the disciple whom <span class="person">Jesus </span>loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span><span class="person">Peter </span>seeing him saith to <span class="person">Jesus</span>, Lord, and what shall this man do? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span><span class="person">Jesus </span>saith unto him, <span class="word">If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet <span class="person">Jesus </span>said not unto him, He shall not die; but, <span class="word">If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And there are also many other things which <span class="person">Jesus </span>did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
