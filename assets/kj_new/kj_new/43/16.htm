<h3>Chapter 16 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span><span class="word">These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span><span class="word"> They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span><span class="word"> And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span><span class="word"> But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span><span class="word"> But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span><span class="word"> But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span><span class="word"> Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span><span class="word"> And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span><span class="word">Of sin, because they believe not on me; </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span><span class="word"> Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span><span class="word">Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span><span class="word"> I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span><span class="word"> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span><span class="word">He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span><span class="word">All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span><span class="word">A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, <span class="word">a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>They said therefore, What is this that he saith, <span class="word">A little while? </span>we cannot tell what he saith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Now <span class="person">Jesus </span>knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, <span class="word">Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span><span class="word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span><span class="word">A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span><span class="word">And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span><span class="word">And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span><span class="word">Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span><span class="word">These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span><span class="word">At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span><span class="word">For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span><span class="word">I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span><span class="person">Jesus </span>answered them, <span class="word">Do ye now believe? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span><span class="word">Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span><span class="word">These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. </span>
