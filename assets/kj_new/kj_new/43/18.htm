<h3>Chapter 18 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>When <span class="person">Jesus </span>had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And <span class="person">Judas </span>also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for <span class="person">Jesus </span>ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span><span class="person">Judas </span>then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span><span class="person">Jesus </span>therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, <span class="word">Whom seek ye? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>They answered him, <span class="person">Jesus </span>of <span class="place">Nazareth</span>. <span class="person">Jesus </span>saith unto them, <span class="word">I am he. </span>And <span class="person">Judas </span>also, which betrayed him, stood with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>As soon then as he had said unto them, <span class="word">I am he, </span>they went backward, and fell to the ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Then asked he them again, <span class="word">Whom seek ye? </span>And they said, <span class="person">Jesus </span>of <span class="place">Nazareth</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span><span class="person">Jesus </span>answered, <span class="word">I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, <span class="word">Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Then <span class="person">Simon </span><span class="person">Peter </span>having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Then said <span class="person">Jesus </span>unto <span class="person">Peter</span>, <span class="word">Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and bound him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to <span class="person">Caiaphas</span>, which was the high priest that same year. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Now <span class="person">Caiaphas </span>was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And <span class="person">Simon </span><span class="person">Peter </span>followed <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with <span class="person">Jesus </span>into the palace of the high priest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But <span class="person">Peter </span>stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in <span class="person">Peter</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto <span class="person">Peter</span>, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and <span class="person">Peter </span>stood with them, and warmed himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>The high priest then asked <span class="person">Jesus </span>of his disciples, and of his doctrine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span><span class="person">Jesus </span>answered him, <span class="word">I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span><span class="word">Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck <span class="person">Jesus </span>with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span><span class="person">Jesus </span>answered him, <span class="word">If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Now Annas had sent him bound unto <span class="person">Caiaphas </span>the high priest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And <span class="person">Simon </span><span class="person">Peter </span>stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear <span class="person">Peter </span>cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span><span class="person">Peter </span>then denied again: and immediately the cock crew. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Then led they <span class="person">Jesus </span>from <span class="person">Caiaphas </span>unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span><span class="person">Pilate </span>then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Then said <span class="person">Pilate </span>unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>That the saying of <span class="person">Jesus </span>might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Then <span class="person">Pilate </span>entered into the judgment hall again, and called <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span><span class="person">Jesus </span>answered him, <span class="word">Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span><span class="person">Pilate </span>answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span><span class="person">Jesus </span>answered, <span class="word">My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span><span class="person">Pilate </span>therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? <span class="person">Jesus </span>answered, <span class="word">Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span><span class="person">Pilate </span>saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but <span class="person">Barabbas</span>. Now <span class="person">Barabbas </span>was a robber.
