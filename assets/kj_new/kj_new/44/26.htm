<h3>Chapter 26 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Then Agrippa said unto <span class="person">Paul</span>, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then <span class="person">Paul </span>stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, know all the Jews; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of <span class="person">Jesus </span>of <span class="place">Nazareth</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Which thing I also did in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Whereupon as I went to <span class="place">Damascus </span>with authority and commission from the chief priests, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, <span class="word"><span class="person">Saul</span>, <span class="person">Saul</span>, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, <span class="word">I am <span class="person">Jesus </span>whom thou persecutest. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span><span class="word">But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span><span class="word">Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span><span class="word">To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of <span class="person">Satan </span>unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>But shewed first unto them of <span class="place">Damascus</span>, and at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and throughout all the coasts of <span class="place">Jud√¶a</span>, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and <span class="person">Moses </span>did say should come: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>That <span class="person">Christ </span>should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, <span class="person">Paul</span>, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Then Agrippa said unto <span class="person">Paul</span>, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And <span class="person">Paul </span>said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto <span class="person">C√¶sar</span>.
