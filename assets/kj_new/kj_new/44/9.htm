<h3>Chapter 9 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And <span class="person">Saul</span>, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And desired of him letters to <span class="place">Damascus </span>to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And as he journeyed, he came near <span class="place">Damascus</span>: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, <span class="word"><span class="person">Saul</span>, <span class="person">Saul</span>, why persecutest thou me? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, <span class="word">I am <span class="person">Jesus </span>whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, <span class="word">Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into <span class="place">Damascus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And there was a certain disciple at <span class="place">Damascus</span>, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, <span class="word">Ananias. </span>And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And the Lord said unto him, <span class="word">Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of <span class="person">Judas </span>for one called <span class="person">Saul</span>, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span><span class="word">And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>But the Lord said unto him, <span class="word">Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span><span class="word">For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother <span class="person">Saul</span>, the Lord, even <span class="person">Jesus</span>, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was <span class="person">Saul </span>certain days with the disciples which were at <span class="place">Damascus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And straightway he preached <span class="person">Christ </span>in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>But <span class="person">Saul </span>increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at <span class="place">Damascus</span>, proving that this is very <span class="person">Christ</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>But their laying await was known of <span class="person">Saul</span>. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And when <span class="person">Saul </span>was come to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at <span class="place">Damascus </span>in the name of <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And he was with them coming in and going out at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to <span class="place">Cæsarea</span>, and sent him forth to Tarsus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Then had the churches rest throughout all <span class="place">Judæa </span>and <span class="place">Galilee </span>and <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And it came to pass, as <span class="person">Peter </span>passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And there he found a certain man named Æneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And <span class="person">Peter </span>said unto him, Æneas, <span class="person">Jesus </span><span class="person">Christ </span>maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that <span class="person">Peter </span>was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>Then <span class="person">Peter </span>arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>But <span class="person">Peter </span>put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw <span class="person">Peter</span>, she sat up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one <span class="person">Simon </span>a tanner.
