<h3>Chapter 18 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>After these things <span class="person">Paul </span>departed from <span class="place">Athens</span>, and came to Corinth; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from <span class="place">Italy</span>, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from <span class="place">Macedonia</span>, <span class="person">Paul </span>was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that <span class="person">Jesus </span>was <span class="person">Christ</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Then spake the Lord to <span class="person">Paul </span>in the night by a vision, <span class="word">Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span><span class="word">For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against <span class="person">Paul</span>, and brought him to the judgment seat, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And when <span class="person">Paul </span>was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And he drave them from the judgment seat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And <span class="person">Paul </span>after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into <span class="place">Syria</span>, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And when he had landed at <span class="place">CÃ¦sarea</span>, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of <span class="person">John</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that <span class="person">Jesus </span>was <span class="person">Christ</span>.
