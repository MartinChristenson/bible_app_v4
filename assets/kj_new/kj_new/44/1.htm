<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that <span class="person">Jesus </span>began both to do and teach, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, <span class="word">but wait for the promise of the Father, which, </span>saith he, <span class="word">ye have heard of me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span><span class="word">For <span class="person">John </span>truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to <span class="place">Israel</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And he said unto them, <span class="word">It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span><span class="word">But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and in all <span class="place">Judaea</span>, and in <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Which also said, Ye men of <span class="place">Galilee</span>, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same <span class="person">Jesus</span>, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Then returned they unto <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>from the mount called Olivet, which is from <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>a sabbath day's journey. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both <span class="person">Peter</span>, and <span class="person">James</span>, and <span class="person">John</span>, and <span class="person">Andrew</span>, <span class="person">Philip</span>, and <span class="person">Thomas</span>, <span class="person">Bartholomew</span>, and <span class="person">Matthew</span>, <span class="person">James </span>the son of <span class="person">Alphaeus</span>, and <span class="person">Simon </span>Zelotes, and <span class="person">Judas </span>the brother of <span class="person">James</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and <span class="person">Mary </span>the mother of <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and with his brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And in those days <span class="person">Peter </span>stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of <span class="person">David </span>spake before concerning <span class="person">Judas</span>, which was guide to them that took <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And it was known unto all the dwellers at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord <span class="person">Jesus </span>went in and out among us, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Beginning from the baptism of <span class="person">John</span>, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And they appointed two, <span class="person">Joseph </span>called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which <span class="person">Judas </span>by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
