<h3>Chapter 28 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And when <span class="person">Paul </span>had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom <span class="person">Paul </span>entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when <span class="person">Paul </span>saw, he thanked God, and took courage. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but <span class="person">Paul </span>was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And it came to pass, that after three days <span class="person">Paul </span>called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>into the hands of the Romans. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto <span class="person">Cæsar</span>; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of <span class="place">Israel </span>I am bound with this chain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of <span class="place">Judæa </span>concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning <span class="person">Jesus</span>, both out of the law of <span class="person">Moses</span>, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that <span class="person">Paul </span>had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And <span class="person">Paul </span>dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord <span class="person">Jesus </span><span class="person">Christ</span>, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
