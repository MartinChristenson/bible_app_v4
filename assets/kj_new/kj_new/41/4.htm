<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span><span class="word">Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span><span class="word">And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span><span class="word">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span><span class="word">But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span><span class="word">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span><span class="word">And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And he said unto them, <span class="word">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And he said unto them, <span class="word">Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span><span class="word">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And he said unto them, <span class="word">Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span><span class="word">The sower soweth the word. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span><span class="word">And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, <span class="person">Satan </span>cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span><span class="word">And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span><span class="word">And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span><span class="word">And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span><span class="word">And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span><span class="word">And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And he said unto them, <span class="word">Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span><span class="word">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span><span class="word">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And he said unto them, <span class="word">Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span><span class="word">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And he said, <span class="word">So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span><span class="word">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span><span class="word">For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span><span class="word">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And he said, <span class="word">Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span><span class="word">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span><span class="word">But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, <span class="word">Let us pass over unto the other side. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, <span class="word">Peace, be still. </span>And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And he said unto them, <span class="word">Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
