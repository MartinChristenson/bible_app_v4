<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>The beginning of the gospel of <span class="person">Jesus </span><span class="person">Christ</span>, the Son of God; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span><span class="person">John </span>did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And there went out unto him all the land of <span class="place">Jud√¶a</span>, and they of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and were all baptized of him in the river of <span class="place">Jordan</span>, confessing their sins. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And <span class="person">John </span>was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And it came to pass in those days, that <span class="person">Jesus </span>came from <span class="place">Nazareth </span>of <span class="place">Galilee</span>, and was baptized of <span class="person">John </span>in <span class="place">Jordan</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of <span class="person">Satan</span>; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Now after that <span class="person">John </span>was put in prison, <span class="person">Jesus </span>came into <span class="place">Galilee</span>, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And saying, <span class="word">The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Now as he walked by the sea of <span class="place">Galilee</span>, he saw <span class="person">Simon </span>and <span class="person">Andrew </span>his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And <span class="person">Jesus </span>said unto them, <span class="word">Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw <span class="person">James </span>the son of <span class="person">Zebedee</span>, and <span class="person">John </span>his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And straightway he called them: and they left their father <span class="person">Zebedee </span>in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And they went into <span class="place">Capernaum</span>; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou <span class="person">Jesus </span>of <span class="place">Nazareth</span>? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And <span class="person">Jesus </span>rebuked him, saying, <span class="word">Hold thy peace, and come out of him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about <span class="place">Galilee</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of <span class="person">Simon </span>and <span class="person">Andrew</span>, with <span class="person">James </span>and <span class="person">John</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>But <span class="person">Simon</span>'s wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And all the city was gathered together at the door. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And <span class="person">Simon </span>and they that were with him followed after him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>And he said unto them, <span class="word">Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all <span class="place">Galilee</span>, and cast out devils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And <span class="person">Jesus</span>, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, <span class="word">I will; be thou clean. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And saith unto him, <span class="word">See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which <span class="person">Moses </span>commanded, for a testimony unto them. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that <span class="person">Jesus </span>could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
