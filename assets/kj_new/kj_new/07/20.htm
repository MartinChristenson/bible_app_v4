<h3>Chapter 20 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Then all the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from <span class="place">Dan </span>even to <span class="place">Beersheba</span>, with the land of <span class="place">Gilead</span>, unto the LORD in Mizpeh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>(Now the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>heard that the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Tell us, how was this wickedness? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, I and my concubine, to lodge. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of <span class="place">Israel</span>: for they have committed lewdness and folly in <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Behold, ye are all children of <span class="place">Israel</span>; give here your advice and counsel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, according to all the folly that they have wrought in <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>So all the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>were gathered against the city, knit together as one man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And the tribes of <span class="place">Israel </span>sent men through all the tribe of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from <span class="place">Israel</span>. But the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And the men of <span class="place">Israel</span>, beside <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>? And the LORD said, <span class="person">Judah </span>shall go up first. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>went out to battle against <span class="person">Benjamin</span>; and the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And the people the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>(And the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>came near against the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>the second day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And <span class="person">Benjamin </span>went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Then all the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And <span class="person">Phinehas</span>, the son of <span class="person">Eleazar</span>, the son of <span class="person">Aaron</span>, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And <span class="place">Israel </span>set liers in wait round about Gibeah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>went up against the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And all the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of <span class="place">Israel </span>came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all <span class="place">Israel</span>, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And the LORD smote <span class="person">Benjamin </span>before <span class="place">Israel</span>: and the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>So the children of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>saw that they were smitten: for the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span>Now there was an appointed sign between the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span>And when the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>retired in the battle, <span class="person">Benjamin </span>began to smite and kill of the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span>But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span>And when the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>turned again, the men of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span>Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span>And there fell of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span>So that all which fell that day of <span class="person">Benjamin </span>were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47 </span>But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48 </span>And the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>turned again upon the children of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.
