<h3>Chapter 8 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And the men of <span class="person">Ephraim </span>said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of <span class="person">Ephraim </span>better than the vintage of Abiezer? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>God hath delivered into your hands the princes of <span class="person">Midian</span>, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And <span class="person">Gideon </span>came to <span class="place">Jordan</span>, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And he said unto the men of <span class="place">Succoth</span>, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of <span class="person">Midian</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And the princes of <span class="place">Succoth </span>said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And <span class="person">Gideon </span>said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And he went up thence to <span class="place">Penuel</span>, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of <span class="place">Penuel </span>answered him as the men of <span class="place">Succoth </span>had answered him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And he spake also unto the men of <span class="place">Penuel</span>, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And <span class="person">Gideon </span>went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of <span class="person">Midian</span>, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And <span class="person">Gideon </span>the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And caught a young man of the men of <span class="place">Succoth</span>, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of <span class="place">Succoth</span>, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And he came unto the men of <span class="place">Succoth</span>, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of <span class="place">Succoth</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And he beat down the tower of <span class="place">Penuel</span>, and slew the men of the city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And <span class="person">Gideon </span>arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Then the men of <span class="place">Israel </span>said unto <span class="person">Gideon</span>, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of <span class="person">Midian</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And <span class="person">Gideon </span>said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And <span class="person">Gideon </span>said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of <span class="person">Midian</span>, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And <span class="person">Gideon </span>made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all <span class="place">Israel </span>went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto <span class="person">Gideon</span>, and to his house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Thus was <span class="person">Midian </span>subdued before the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of <span class="person">Gideon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And <span class="person">Gideon </span>had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called <span class="person">Abimelech</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And <span class="person">Gideon </span>the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And it came to pass, as soon as <span class="person">Gideon </span>was dead, that the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, <span class="person">Gideon</span>, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto <span class="place">Israel</span>.
