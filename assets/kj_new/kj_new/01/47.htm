<h3>Chapter 47</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Then <span class="person">Joseph </span>came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>; and, behold, they are in the land of <span class="place">Goshen</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of <span class="place">Goshen</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And Pharaoh spake unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>The land of <span class="place">Egypt </span>is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of <span class="place">Goshen </span>let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>brought in <span class="person">Jacob </span>his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and <span class="person">Jacob </span>blessed Pharaoh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And Pharaoh said unto <span class="person">Jacob</span>, How old art thou? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And <span class="person">Jacob </span>said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And <span class="person">Jacob </span>blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, in the best of the land, in the land of <span class="place">Rameses</span>, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of <span class="place">Egypt </span>and all the land of <span class="place">Canaan </span>fainted by reason of the famine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>gathered up all the money that was found in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and in the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>, for the corn which they bought: and <span class="person">Joseph </span>brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And when money failed in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and in the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>, all the Egyptians came unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And they brought their cattle unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>: and <span class="person">Joseph </span>gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>bought all the land of <span class="place">Egypt </span>for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of <span class="place">Egypt </span>even to the other end thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Then <span class="person">Joseph </span>said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>made it a law over the land of <span class="place">Egypt </span>unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And <span class="place">Israel </span>dwelt in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, in the country of <span class="place">Goshen</span>; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And <span class="person">Jacob </span>lived in the land of <span class="place">Egypt </span>seventeen years: so the whole age of <span class="person">Jacob </span>was an hundred forty and seven years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And the time drew nigh that <span class="place">Israel </span>must die: and he called his son <span class="person">Joseph</span>, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in <span class="place">Egypt</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And <span class="place">Israel </span>bowed himself upon the bed's head.
