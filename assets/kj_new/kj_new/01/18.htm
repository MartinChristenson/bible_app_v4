<h3>Chapter 18 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of <span class="place">Mamre</span>: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And <span class="person">Abraham </span>hastened into the tent unto <span class="person">Sarah</span>, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And <span class="person">Abraham </span>ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And they said unto him, Where is <span class="person">Sarah </span>thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, <span class="person">Sarah </span>thy wife shall have a son. And <span class="person">Sarah </span>heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Now <span class="person">Abraham </span>and <span class="person">Sarah </span>were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with <span class="person">Sarah </span>after the manner of women. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Therefore <span class="person">Sarah </span>laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Abraham</span>, Wherefore did <span class="person">Sarah </span>laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and <span class="person">Sarah </span>shall have a son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Then <span class="person">Sarah </span>denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward <span class="place">Sodom</span>: and <span class="person">Abraham </span>went with them to bring them on the way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And the LORD said, Shall I hide from <span class="person">Abraham </span>that thing which I do; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Seeing that <span class="person">Abraham </span>shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon <span class="person">Abraham </span>that which he hath spoken of him.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And the LORD said, Because the cry of <span class="place">Sodom </span>and <span class="place">Gomorrah </span>is great, and because their sin is very grievous; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward <span class="place">Sodom</span>: but <span class="person">Abraham </span>stood yet before the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And <span class="person">Abraham </span>drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And the LORD said, If I find in <span class="place">Sodom </span>fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And <span class="person">Abraham </span>answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with <span class="person">Abraham</span>: and <span class="person">Abraham </span>returned unto his place.
