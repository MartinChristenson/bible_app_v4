<h3>Chapter 50</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And when the days of his mourning were past, <span class="person">Joseph </span>spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And all the house of <span class="person">Joseph</span>, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of <span class="place">Goshen</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And they came to the threshingfloor of <span class="person">Atad</span>, which is beyond <span class="place">Jordan</span>, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of <span class="person">Atad</span>, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called <span class="place">Abelmizraim</span>, which is beyond <span class="place">Jordan</span>.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>For his sons carried him into the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>, and buried him in the cave of the field of <span class="person">Machpelah</span>, which <span class="person">Abraham </span>bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of <span class="person">Ephron </span>the Hittite, before <span class="place">Mamre</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>returned into <span class="place">Egypt</span>, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And when <span class="person">Joseph</span>'s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, <span class="person">Joseph </span>will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And they sent a messenger unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>So shall ye say unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And <span class="person">Joseph </span>wept when they spake unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>dwelt in <span class="place">Egypt</span>, he, and his father's house: and <span class="person">Joseph </span>lived an hundred and ten years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>saw <span class="person">Ephraim</span>'s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of <span class="person">Manasseh </span>were brought up upon <span class="person">Joseph</span>'s knees. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to <span class="person">Abraham</span>, to <span class="person">Isaac</span>, and to <span class="person">Jacob</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And <span class="person">Joseph </span>took an oath of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>So <span class="person">Joseph </span>died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in <span class="place">Egypt</span>.
