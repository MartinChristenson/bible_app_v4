<h3>Chapter 34 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And <span class="person">Dinah </span>the daughter of <span class="person">Leah</span>, which she bare unto <span class="person">Jacob</span>, went out to see the daughters of the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And when Shechem the son of <span class="person">Hamor </span>the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And his soul clave unto <span class="person">Dinah </span>the daughter of <span class="person">Jacob</span>, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Shechem spake unto his father <span class="person">Hamor</span>, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And <span class="person">Jacob </span>heard that he had defiled <span class="person">Dinah </span>his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and <span class="person">Jacob </span>held his peace until they were come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And <span class="person">Hamor </span>the father of Shechem went out unto <span class="person">Jacob </span>to commune with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And the sons of <span class="person">Jacob </span>came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in <span class="place">Israel </span>in lying with <span class="person">Jacob</span>'s daughter; which thing ought not to be done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And <span class="person">Hamor </span>communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And the sons of <span class="person">Jacob </span>answered Shechem and <span class="person">Hamor </span>his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled <span class="person">Dinah </span>their sister: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And their words pleased <span class="person">Hamor</span>, and Shechem <span class="person">Hamor</span>'s son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in <span class="person">Jacob</span>'s daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And <span class="person">Hamor </span>and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And unto <span class="person">Hamor </span>and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of <span class="person">Jacob</span>, <span class="person">Simeon </span>and <span class="person">Levi</span>, <span class="person">Dinah</span>'s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And they slew <span class="person">Hamor </span>and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took <span class="person">Dinah </span>out of Shechem's house, and went out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>The sons of <span class="person">Jacob </span>came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And <span class="person">Jacob </span>said to <span class="person">Simeon </span>and <span class="person">Levi</span>, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
