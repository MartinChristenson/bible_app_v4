<h3>Chapter 5 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of <span class="place">Jordan </span>westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of <span class="place">Jordan </span>from before the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>At that time the LORD said unto <span class="person">Joshua</span>, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>the second time. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And <span class="person">Joshua </span>made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>at the hill of the foreskins. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And this is the cause why <span class="person">Joshua </span>did circumcise: All the people that came out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, them they had not circumcised. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>For the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them <span class="person">Joshua </span>circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Joshua</span>, This day have I rolled away the reproach of <span class="place">Egypt </span>from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of <span class="place">Jericho</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of <span class="place">Canaan </span>that year. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And it came to pass, when <span class="person">Joshua </span>was by <span class="place">Jericho</span>, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and <span class="person">Joshua </span>went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And <span class="person">Joshua </span>fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And the captain of the LORD's host said unto <span class="person">Joshua</span>, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And <span class="person">Joshua </span>did so.
