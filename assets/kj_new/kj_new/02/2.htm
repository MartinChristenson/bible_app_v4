<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And there went a man of the house of <span class="person">Levi</span>, and took to wife a daughter of <span class="person">Levi</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name <span class="person">Moses</span>: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And it came to pass in those days, when <span class="person">Moses </span>was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And <span class="person">Moses </span>feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay <span class="person">Moses</span>. But <span class="person">Moses </span>fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of <span class="person">Midian</span>: and he sat down by a well. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Now the priest of <span class="person">Midian </span>had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but <span class="person">Moses </span>stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And when they came to <span class="person">Reuel </span>their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And <span class="person">Moses </span>was content to dwell with the man: and he gave <span class="person">Moses </span><span class="person">Zipporah </span>his daughter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And she bare him a son, and he called his name <span class="person">Gershom</span>: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of <span class="place">Egypt </span>died: and the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with <span class="person">Abraham</span>, with <span class="person">Isaac</span>, and with <span class="person">Jacob</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And God looked upon the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and God had respect unto them.
