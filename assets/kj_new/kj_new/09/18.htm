<h3>Chapter 18 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto <span class="person">Saul</span>, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of <span class="person">David</span>, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Then Jonathan and <span class="person">David </span>made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to <span class="person">David</span>, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>went out whithersoever <span class="person">Saul </span>sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and <span class="person">Saul </span>set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of <span class="person">Saul</span>'s servants. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And it came to pass as they came, when <span class="person">David </span>was returned from the slaughter of the <span class="place">Philistine</span>, that the women came out of all cities of <span class="place">Israel</span>, singing and dancing, to meet king <span class="person">Saul</span>, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And the women answered one another as they played, and said, <span class="person">Saul </span>hath slain his thousands, and <span class="person">David </span>his ten thousands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto <span class="person">David </span>ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>eyed <span class="person">David </span>from that day and forward. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon <span class="person">Saul</span>, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and <span class="person">David </span>played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in <span class="person">Saul</span>'s hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite <span class="person">David </span>even to the wall with it. And <span class="person">David </span>avoided out of his presence twice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>was afraid of <span class="person">David</span>, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from <span class="person">Saul</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Therefore <span class="person">Saul </span>removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Wherefore when <span class="person">Saul </span>saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>But all <span class="place">Israel </span>and <span class="person">Judah </span>loved <span class="person">David</span>, because he went out and came in before them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>said to <span class="person">David</span>, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For <span class="person">Saul </span>said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>said unto <span class="person">Saul</span>, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in <span class="place">Israel</span>, that I should be son in law to the king? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>But it came to pass at the time when Merab <span class="person">Saul</span>'s daughter should have been given to <span class="person">David</span>, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And Michal <span class="person">Saul</span>'s daughter loved <span class="person">David</span>: and they told <span class="person">Saul</span>, and the thing pleased him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore <span class="person">Saul </span>said to <span class="person">David</span>, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>commanded his servants, saying, Commune with <span class="person">David </span>secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And <span class="person">Saul</span>'s servants spake those words in the ears of <span class="person">David</span>. And <span class="person">David </span>said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And the servants of <span class="person">Saul </span>told him, saying, <span class="place">On </span>this manner spake <span class="person">David</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>said, Thus shall ye say to <span class="person">David</span>, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But <span class="person">Saul </span>thought to make <span class="person">David </span>fall by the hand of the Philistines. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And when his servants told <span class="person">David </span>these words, it pleased <span class="person">David </span>well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Wherefore <span class="person">David </span>arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and <span class="person">David </span>brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And <span class="person">Saul </span>gave him Michal his daughter to wife. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>saw and knew that the LORD was with <span class="person">David</span>, and that Michal <span class="person">Saul</span>'s daughter loved him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>was yet the more afraid of <span class="person">David</span>; and <span class="person">Saul </span>became <span class="person">David</span>'s enemy continually. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that <span class="person">David </span>behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of <span class="person">Saul</span>; so that his name was much set by.
