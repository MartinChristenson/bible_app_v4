<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, and his name was <span class="person">Elkanah</span>, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and <span class="person">Phinehas</span>, the priests of the LORD, were there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And when the time was that <span class="person">Elkanah </span>offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Then said <span class="person">Elkanah </span>her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of <span class="place">Israel </span>grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and <span class="person">Elkanah </span>knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name <span class="person">Samuel</span>, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And the man <span class="person">Elkanah</span>, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And <span class="person">Elkanah </span>her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.
