<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And <span class="person">Elkanah </span>went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>But <span class="person">Samuel </span>ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And Eli blessed <span class="person">Elkanah </span>and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child <span class="person">Samuel </span>grew before the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all <span class="place">Israel</span>; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And the child <span class="person">Samuel </span>grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in <span class="place">Egypt </span>in Pharaoh's house? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of <span class="place">Israel </span>to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of <span class="place">Israel </span>my people? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Wherefore the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel </span>saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give <span class="place">Israel</span>: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and <span class="person">Phinehas</span>; in one day they shall die both of them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.
