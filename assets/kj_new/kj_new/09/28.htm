<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with <span class="place">Israel</span>. And Achish said unto <span class="person">David</span>, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to <span class="person">David</span>, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Now <span class="person">Samuel </span>was dead, and all <span class="place">Israel </span>had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And <span class="person">Saul </span>had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and <span class="person">Saul </span>gathered all <span class="place">Israel </span>together, and they pitched in Gilboa. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And when <span class="person">Saul </span>saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And when <span class="person">Saul </span>enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Then said <span class="person">Saul </span>unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what <span class="person">Saul </span>hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And <span class="person">Saul </span>sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up <span class="person">Samuel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And when the woman saw <span class="person">Samuel</span>, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to <span class="person">Saul</span>, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art <span class="person">Saul</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto <span class="person">Saul</span>, I saw gods ascending out of the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And <span class="person">Saul </span>perceived that it was <span class="person">Samuel</span>, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And <span class="person">Samuel </span>said to <span class="person">Saul</span>, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And <span class="person">Saul </span>answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Then said <span class="person">Samuel</span>, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to <span class="person">David</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon <span class="person">Amalek</span>, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Moreover the LORD will also deliver <span class="place">Israel </span>with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of <span class="place">Israel </span>into the hand of the Philistines. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Then <span class="person">Saul </span>fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of <span class="person">Samuel</span>: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And the woman came unto <span class="person">Saul</span>, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And she brought it before <span class="person">Saul</span>, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
