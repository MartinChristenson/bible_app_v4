<h3>Chapter 21 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span><span class="person">Manasseh </span>was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Hephzibah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of <span class="place">Israel</span>; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>will I put my name. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to <span class="person">David</span>, and to <span class="person">Solomon </span>his son, In this house, and in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, which I have chosen out of all tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>, will I put my name for ever: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Neither will I make the feet of <span class="place">Israel </span>move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant <span class="person">Moses </span>commanded them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But they hearkened not: and <span class="person">Manasseh </span>seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Because <span class="person">Manasseh </span>king of <span class="person">Judah </span>hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made <span class="person">Judah </span>also to sin with his idols: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Therefore thus saith the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>and <span class="person">Judah</span>, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And I will stretch over <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>the line of <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, even unto this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Moreover <span class="person">Manasseh </span>shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made <span class="person">Judah </span>to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Now the rest of the acts of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And <span class="person">Manasseh </span>slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and <span class="person">Amon </span>his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span><span class="person">Amon </span>was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father <span class="person">Manasseh </span>did. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And the servants of <span class="person">Amon </span>conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king <span class="person">Amon</span>; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Now the rest of the acts of <span class="person">Amon </span>which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.
