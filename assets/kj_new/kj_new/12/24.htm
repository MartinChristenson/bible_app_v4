<h3>Chapter 24 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of <span class="place">Babylon </span>came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against <span class="person">Judah </span>to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon <span class="person">Judah</span>, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, according to all that he did; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And the king of <span class="place">Egypt </span>came not again any more out of his land: for the king of <span class="place">Babylon </span>had taken from the river of <span class="place">Egypt </span>unto the river <span class="place">Euphrates </span>all that pertained to the king of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of <span class="place">Babylon </span>came up against <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and the city was besieged. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And Nebuchadnezzar king of <span class="place">Babylon </span>came against the city, and his servants did besiege it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And Jehoiachin the king of <span class="person">Judah </span>went out to the king of <span class="place">Babylon</span>, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of <span class="place">Babylon </span>took him in the eighth year of his reign. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which <span class="person">Solomon </span>king of <span class="place">Israel </span>had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And he carried away all <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And he carried away Jehoiachin to <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>to <span class="place">Babylon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of <span class="place">Babylon </span>brought captive to <span class="place">Babylon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And the king of <span class="place">Babylon </span>made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of <span class="person">Jeremiah </span>of Libnah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>and <span class="person">Judah</span>, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of <span class="place">Babylon</span>.
