<h3>Chapter 13 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of <span class="person">Judah </span>Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over <span class="place">Israel </span>in <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and reigned seventeen years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made <span class="place">Israel </span>to sin; he departed not therefrom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against <span class="place">Israel</span>, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of <span class="place">Syria</span>, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of <span class="place">Israel</span>, because the king of <span class="place">Syria </span>oppressed them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>(And the LORD gave <span class="place">Israel </span>a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>dwelt in their tents, as beforetime. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made <span class="place">Israel </span>sin, but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in <span class="place">Samaria</span>.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of <span class="place">Syria </span>had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in <span class="place">Samaria</span>: and Joash his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of <span class="person">Judah </span>began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over <span class="place">Israel </span>in <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and reigned sixteen years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made <span class="place">Israel </span>sin: but he walked therein. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in <span class="place">Samaria </span>with the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of <span class="place">Israel </span>came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and the horsemen thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And he said to the king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from <span class="place">Syria</span>: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten <span class="place">Syria </span>till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite <span class="place">Syria </span>but thrice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>But Hazael king of <span class="place">Syria </span>oppressed <span class="place">Israel </span>all the days of Jehoahaz. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with <span class="person">Abraham</span>, <span class="person">Isaac</span>, and <span class="person">Jacob</span>, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>So Hazael king of <span class="place">Syria </span>died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of <span class="place">Israel</span>.
