<h3>Chapter 28 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like <span class="person">David </span>his father: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>For he walked in the ways of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and made also molten images for Baalim. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of <span class="place">Syria</span>; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to <span class="place">Damascus</span>. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, who smote him with a great slaughter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in <span class="person">Judah </span>an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And <span class="person">Zichri</span>, a mighty man of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and <span class="person">Elkanah </span>that was next to the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to <span class="place">Samaria</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with <span class="person">Judah</span>, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And now ye purpose to keep under the children of <span class="person">Judah </span>and <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Then certain of the heads of the children of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to <span class="place">Jericho</span>, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to <span class="place">Samaria</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of <span class="place">Assyria </span>to help him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>For again the Edomites had come and smitten <span class="person">Judah</span>, and carried away captives. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and <span class="person">Timnah </span>with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For the LORD brought <span class="person">Judah </span>low because of Ahaz king of <span class="place">Israel</span>; for he made <span class="person">Judah </span>naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And Tilgathpilneser king of <span class="place">Assyria </span>came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of <span class="place">Assyria</span>: but he helped him not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>For he sacrificed unto the gods of <span class="place">Damascus</span>, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of <span class="place">Syria </span>help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And in every several city of <span class="person">Judah </span>he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of <span class="person">Judah </span>and <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
