<h3>Chapter 17 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Then said he unto the disciples, <span class="word">It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span><span class="word">It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span><span class="word"> Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span><span class="word">And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And the Lord said,<span class="word"> If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span><span class="word">But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span><span class="word"> And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span><span class="word">Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span><span class="word"> So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And it came to pass, as he went to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, that he passed through the midst of <span class="place">Samaria </span>and <span class="place">Galilee</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And they lifted up their voices, and said, <span class="person">Jesus</span>, Master, have mercy on us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And when he saw them, he said unto them, <span class="word">Go shew yourselves unto the priests. </span>And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And <span class="person">Jesus </span>answering said, <span class="word">Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span><span class="word">There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And he said unto him, <span class="word">Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, <span class="word">The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span><span class="word"> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And he said unto the disciples, <span class="word">The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span><span class="word">And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span><span class="word">For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span><span class="word">But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span><span class="word"> And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span><span class="word"> They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span><span class="word">Likewise also as it was in the days of <span class="person">Lot</span>; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span><span class="word"> But the same day that <span class="person">Lot </span>went out of <span class="place">Sodom </span>it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span><span class="word"> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span><span class="word">In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span><span class="word">Remember <span class="person">Lot</span>'s wife. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span><span class="word"> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span><span class="word">I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span><span class="word"> Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span><span class="word">Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span>And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them,<span class="word"> Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together. </span>
