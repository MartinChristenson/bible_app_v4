<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>What shall we say then that <span class="person">Abraham </span>our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>For if <span class="person">Abraham </span>were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>For what saith the scripture? <span class="person">Abraham </span>believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Even as <span class="person">David </span>also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to <span class="person">Abraham </span>for righteousness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father <span class="person">Abraham</span>, which he had being yet uncircumcised. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to <span class="person">Abraham</span>, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of <span class="person">Abraham</span>; who is the father of us all, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of <span class="person">Sara</span>'s womb: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up <span class="person">Jesus </span>our Lord from the dead; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
