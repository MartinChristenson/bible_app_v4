<h3>Chapter 7 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of <span class="person">Christ</span>; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>I thank God through <span class="person">Jesus </span><span class="person">Christ </span>our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
