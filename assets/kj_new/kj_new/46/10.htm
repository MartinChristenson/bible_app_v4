<h3>Chapter 10 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And were all baptized unto <span class="person">Moses </span>in the cloud and in the sea; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And did all eat the same spiritual meat; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was <span class="person">Christ</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Neither let us tempt <span class="person">Christ</span>, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of <span class="person">Christ</span>? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of <span class="person">Christ</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Behold <span class="place">Israel </span>after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.
