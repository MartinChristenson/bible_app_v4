<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Then fourteen years after I went up again to <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in <span class="person">Christ </span><span class="person">Jesus</span>, that they might bring us into bondage: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto <span class="person">Peter</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>(For he that wrought effectually in <span class="person">Peter </span>to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And when <span class="person">James</span>, Cephas, and <span class="person">John</span>, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>But when <span class="person">Peter </span>was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>For before that certain came from <span class="person">James</span>, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto <span class="person">Peter </span>before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of <span class="person">Jesus </span><span class="person">Christ</span>, even we have believed in <span class="person">Jesus </span><span class="person">Christ</span>, that we might be justified by the faith of <span class="person">Christ</span>, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>But if, while we seek to be justified by <span class="person">Christ</span>, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore <span class="person">Christ </span>the minister of sin? God forbid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>I am crucified with <span class="person">Christ</span>: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but <span class="person">Christ </span>liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then <span class="person">Christ </span>is dead in vain.
