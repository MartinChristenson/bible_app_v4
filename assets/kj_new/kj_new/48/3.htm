<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes <span class="person">Jesus </span><span class="person">Christ </span>hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Even as <span class="person">Abraham </span>believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of <span class="person">Abraham</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto <span class="person">Abraham</span>, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful <span class="person">Abraham</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span><span class="person">Christ </span>hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>That the blessing of <span class="person">Abraham </span>might come on the Gentiles through <span class="person">Jesus </span><span class="person">Christ</span>; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Now to <span class="person">Abraham </span>and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is <span class="person">Christ</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in <span class="person">Christ</span>, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to <span class="person">Abraham </span>by promise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of <span class="person">Jesus </span><span class="person">Christ </span>might be given to them that believe. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto <span class="person">Christ</span>, that we might be justified by faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>For ye are all the children of God by faith in <span class="person">Christ </span><span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>For as many of you as have been baptized into <span class="person">Christ </span>have put on <span class="person">Christ</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in <span class="person">Christ </span><span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And if ye be <span class="person">Christ</span>'s, then are ye <span class="person">Abraham</span>'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
