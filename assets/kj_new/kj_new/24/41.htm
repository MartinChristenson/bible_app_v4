<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that <span class="person">Ishmael </span>the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to <span class="place">Mizpah</span>; and there they did eat bread together in <span class="place">Mizpah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Then arose <span class="person">Ishmael </span>the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of <span class="place">Babylon </span>had made governor over the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span><span class="person">Ishmael </span>also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at <span class="place">Mizpah</span>, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from <span class="place">Samaria</span>, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And <span class="person">Ishmael </span>the son of Nethaniah went forth from <span class="place">Mizpah </span>to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that <span class="person">Ishmael </span>the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>But ten men were found among them that said unto <span class="person">Ishmael</span>, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Now the pit wherein <span class="person">Ishmael </span>had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which <span class="person">Asa </span>the king had made for fear of Baasha king of <span class="place">Israel</span>: and <span class="person">Ishmael </span>the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Then <span class="person">Ishmael </span>carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in <span class="place">Mizpah</span>, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in <span class="place">Mizpah</span>, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and <span class="person">Ishmael </span>the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that <span class="person">Ishmael </span>the son of Nethaniah had done, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Then they took all the men, and went to fight with <span class="person">Ishmael </span>the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with <span class="person">Ishmael </span>saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>So all the people that <span class="person">Ishmael </span>had carried away captive from <span class="place">Mizpah </span>cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>But <span class="person">Ishmael </span>the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from <span class="person">Ishmael </span>the son of Nethaniah, from <span class="place">Mizpah</span>, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by <span class="place">Bethlehem</span>, to go to enter into <span class="place">Egypt</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because <span class="person">Ishmael </span>the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of <span class="place">Babylon </span>made governor in the land.
