<h3>Chapter 24 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless <span class="place">Israel</span>, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw <span class="place">Israel </span>abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of <span class="person">Beor </span>hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>How goodly are thy tents, O <span class="person">Jacob</span>, and thy tabernacles, O <span class="place">Israel</span>! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>God brought him forth out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of <span class="person">Beor </span>hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of <span class="person">Jacob</span>, and a Sceptre shall rise out of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and shall smite the corners of <span class="person">Moab</span>, and destroy all the children of Sheth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And <span class="person">Edom </span>shall be a possession, <span class="place">Seir </span>also shall be a possession for his enemies; and <span class="place">Israel </span>shall do valiantly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Out of <span class="person">Jacob </span>shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And when he looked on <span class="person">Amalek</span>, he took up his parable, and said, <span class="person">Amalek </span>was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until <span class="person">Asshur </span>shall carry thee away captive. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict <span class="person">Asshur</span>, and shall afflict <span class="person">Eber</span>, and he also shall perish for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.
