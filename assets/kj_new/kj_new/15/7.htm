<h3>Chapter 7 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>The son of Abishua, the son of <span class="person">Phinehas</span>, the son of <span class="person">Eleazar</span>, the son of <span class="person">Aaron </span>the chief priest: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>This Ezra went up from <span class="place">Babylon</span>; and he was a ready scribe in the law of <span class="person">Moses</span>, which the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel </span>had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And there went up some of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And he came to <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, according to the good hand of his God upon him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in <span class="place">Israel </span>statutes and judgments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>I make a decree, that all they of the people of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, go with thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning <span class="person">Judah </span>and <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, whose habitation is in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of <span class="place">Babylon</span>, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of <span class="place">Israel </span>chief men to go up with me.
