<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of <span class="place">Sodom</span>, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of <span class="person">Edom</span>, that dwellest in the land of <span class="person">Uz</span>; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of <span class="person">Edom</span>; he will discover thy sins.
