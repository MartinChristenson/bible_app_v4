<h3>Chapter 6 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Again, <span class="person">David </span>gathered together all the chosen men of <span class="place">Israel</span>, thirty thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of <span class="person">Judah</span>, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>and all the house of <span class="place">Israel </span>played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>So <span class="person">David </span>would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of <span class="person">David</span>: but <span class="person">David </span>carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And it was told king <span class="person">David</span>, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So <span class="person">David </span>went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of <span class="person">David </span>with gladness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>danced before the LORD with all his might; and <span class="person">David </span>was girded with a linen ephod. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>So <span class="person">David </span>and all the house of <span class="place">Israel </span>brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of <span class="person">David</span>, Michal <span class="person">Saul</span>'s daughter looked through a window, and saw king <span class="person">David </span>leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that <span class="person">David </span>had pitched for it: and <span class="person">David </span>offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And as soon as <span class="person">David </span>had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of <span class="place">Israel</span>, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Then <span class="person">David </span>returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of <span class="person">Saul </span>came out to meet <span class="person">David</span>, and said, How glorious was the king of <span class="place">Israel </span>to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over <span class="place">Israel</span>: therefore will I play before the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Therefore Michal the daughter of <span class="person">Saul </span>had no child unto the day of her death.
