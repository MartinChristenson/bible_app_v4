<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And when <span class="person">Saul</span>'s son heard that Abner was dead in <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span>, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And <span class="person">Saul</span>'s son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to <span class="person">Benjamin</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Jonathan, <span class="person">Saul</span>'s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of <span class="person">Saul </span>and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto <span class="person">David </span>to <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span>, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of <span class="person">Saul </span>thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of <span class="person">Saul</span>, and of his seed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>When one told me, saying, Behold, <span class="person">Saul </span>is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span>. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span>.
