<h3>Chapter 11 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to <span class="person">Christ</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled <span class="person">Eve </span>through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in <span class="person">Christ</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>For if he that cometh preacheth another <span class="person">Jesus</span>, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from <span class="place">Macedonia </span>supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>As the truth of <span class="person">Christ </span>is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of <span class="person">Christ</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>And no marvel; for <span class="person">Satan </span>himself is transformed into an angel of light. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of <span class="person">Abraham</span>? so am I. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Are they ministers of <span class="person">Christ</span>? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>The God and Father of our Lord <span class="person">Jesus </span><span class="person">Christ</span>, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>In <span class="place">Damascus </span>the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
