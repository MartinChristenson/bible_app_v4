<h3>Chapter 6 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, saying, There is a king in <span class="person">Judah</span>: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Moreover in those days the nobles of <span class="person">Judah </span>sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>For there were many in <span class="person">Judah </span>sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
