<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Not as <span class="person">Cain</span>, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son <span class="person">Jesus </span><span class="person">Christ</span>, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
