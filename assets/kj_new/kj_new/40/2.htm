<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now when <span class="person">Jesus </span>was born in <span class="place">Bethlehem </span>of <span class="place">Judaea </span>in the days of <span class="person">Herod </span>the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>When <span class="person">Herod </span>the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all <span class="place">Jerusalem </span>with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where <span class="person">Christ </span>should be born. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And they said unto him, In <span class="place">Bethlehem </span>of <span class="place">Judaea</span>: for thus it is written by the prophet, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And thou <span class="place">Bethlehem</span>, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Then <span class="person">Herod</span>, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And he sent them to <span class="place">Bethlehem</span>, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with <span class="person">Mary </span>his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to <span class="person">Herod</span>, they departed into their own country another way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to <span class="person">Joseph </span>in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for <span class="person">Herod </span>will seek the young child to destroy him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into <span class="place">Egypt</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And was there until the death of <span class="person">Herod</span>: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of <span class="place">Egypt </span>have I called my son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Then <span class="person">Herod</span>, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in <span class="place">Bethlehem</span>, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>In <span class="place">Rama </span>was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, <span class="person">Rachel </span>weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>But when <span class="person">Herod </span>was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to <span class="person">Joseph </span>in <span class="place">Egypt</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of <span class="place">Israel</span>: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in <span class="place">Judaea </span>in the room of his father <span class="person">Herod</span>, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of <span class="place">Galilee</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And he came and dwelt in a city called <span class="place">Nazareth</span>: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
