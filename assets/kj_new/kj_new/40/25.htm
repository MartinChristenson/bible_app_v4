<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span><span class="word">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span><span class="word">And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span><span class="word">They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span><span class="word">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span><span class="word">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span><span class="word">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span><span class="word">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span><span class="word">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span><span class="word">But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span><span class="word">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span><span class="word">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span><span class="word">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span><span class="word"> Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span><span class="word">For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span><span class="word"> And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span><span class="word">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span><span class="word"> And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span><span class="word">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span><span class="word">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span><span class="word"> And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span><span class="word">His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span><span class="word"> He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span><span class="word">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span><span class="word">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span><span class="word">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span><span class="word"> His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span><span class="word">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span><span class="word">Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span><span class="word">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span><span class="word">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span><span class="word"> When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span><span class="word">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span><span class="word">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span><span class="word">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35 </span><span class="word">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36 </span><span class="word">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37 </span><span class="word">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38 </span><span class="word">When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39 </span><span class="word"> Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40 </span><span class="word">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41 </span><span class="word"> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42 </span><span class="word">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43 </span><span class="word">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44 </span><span class="word">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45 </span><span class="word"> Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46 </span><span class="word">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. </span>
