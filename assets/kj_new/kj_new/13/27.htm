<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anetothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>But <span class="person">David </span>took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase <span class="place">Israel </span>like to the stars of the heavens. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against <span class="place">Israel</span>; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king <span class="person">David</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was <span class="person">Baalhanan </span>the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:

<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>Also Jonathan <span class="person">David</span>'s uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the king's companion:
