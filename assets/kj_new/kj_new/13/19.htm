<h3>Chapter 19 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And <span class="person">David </span>said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And <span class="person">David </span>sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of <span class="person">David </span>came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that <span class="person">David </span>doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Wherefore Hanun took <span class="person">David</span>'s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Then there went certain, and told <span class="person">David </span>how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at <span class="place">Jericho </span>until your beards be grown, and then return. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to <span class="person">David</span>, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of <span class="place">Mesopotamia</span>, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of <span class="person">Maachah </span>and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And when <span class="person">David </span>heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and put them in array against the Syrians. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before <span class="place">Israel</span>, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And it was told <span class="person">David</span>; and he gathered all <span class="place">Israel</span>, and passed over <span class="place">Jordan</span>, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when <span class="person">David </span>had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>But the Syrians fled before <span class="place">Israel</span>; and <span class="person">David </span>slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before <span class="place">Israel</span>, they made peace with <span class="person">David</span>, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
