<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now the sons of <span class="person">Reuben </span>the firstborn of <span class="place">Israel</span>, (for he was the firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given unto the sons of <span class="person">Joseph </span>the son of <span class="place">Israel</span>: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>For <span class="person">Judah </span>prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was <span class="person">Joseph</span>'s:) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>The sons, I say, of <span class="person">Reuben </span>the firstborn of <span class="place">Israel </span>were, <span class="person">Hanoch</span>, and Pallu, <span class="person">Hezron</span>, and <span class="person">Carmi</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of <span class="place">Assyria </span>carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And <span class="place">Bela </span>the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from the river <span class="place">Euphrates</span>: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of <span class="place">Gilead</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And in the days of <span class="person">Saul </span>they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east land of <span class="place">Gilead</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And the children of <span class="person">Gad </span>dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan unto Salchah: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And their brethren of the house of their fathers were, Michael, and Meshullam, and <span class="person">Sheba</span>, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and <span class="person">Heber</span>, seven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of <span class="place">Gilead</span>, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of <span class="person">Buz</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of <span class="person">Guni</span>, chief of the house of their fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And they dwelt in <span class="place">Gilead </span>in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and in the days of Jeroboam king of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>The sons of <span class="person">Reuben</span>, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the war. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And the children of the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh </span>dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even <span class="person">Epher</span>, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and <span class="person">Jeremiah</span>, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and heads of the house of their fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And the God of <span class="place">Israel </span>stirred up the spirit of Pul king of <span class="place">Assyria</span>, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of <span class="place">Assyria</span>, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.
