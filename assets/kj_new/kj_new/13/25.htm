<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, <span class="person">Uzziel</span>, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth:
