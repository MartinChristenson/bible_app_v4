<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning <span class="person">Edom</span>; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>How are the things of <span class="person">Esau </span>searched out! how are his hidden things sought up! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of <span class="person">Edom</span>, and understanding out of the mount of <span class="person">Esau</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And thy mighty men, O <span class="person">Teman</span>, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of <span class="person">Esau </span>may be cut off by slaughter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>For thy violence against thy brother <span class="person">Jacob </span>shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, even thou wast as one of them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of <span class="person">Judah </span>in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of <span class="person">Jacob </span>shall possess their possessions. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And the house of <span class="person">Jacob </span>shall be a fire, and the house of <span class="person">Joseph </span>a flame, and the house of <span class="person">Esau </span>for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of <span class="person">Esau</span>; for the LORD hath spoken it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And they of the south shall possess the mount of <span class="person">Esau</span>; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, and the fields of <span class="place">Samaria</span>: and <span class="person">Benjamin </span>shall possess <span class="place">Gilead</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And the captivity of this host of the children of <span class="place">Israel </span>shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of <span class="person">Esau</span>; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.
