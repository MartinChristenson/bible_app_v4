<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>So king <span class="person">Solomon </span>was king over all <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And <span class="person">Solomon </span>had twelve officers over all <span class="place">Israel</span>, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And these are their names: The son of <span class="person">Hur</span>, in mount <span class="person">Ephraim</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of <span class="person">Solomon </span>to wife: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, which are in <span class="place">Gilead</span>; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>Ahinadab the son of Iddo had <span class="place">Mahanaim</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>Ahimaaz was in <span class="person">Naphtali</span>; he also took Basmath the daughter of <span class="person">Solomon </span>to wife: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>Baanah the son of Hushai was in <span class="person">Asher </span>and in Aloth: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in <span class="person">Issachar</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Shimei the son of <span class="person">Elah</span>, in <span class="person">Benjamin</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>Geber the son of <span class="person">Uri </span>was in the country of <span class="place">Gilead</span>, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span><span class="person">Judah </span>and <span class="place">Israel </span>were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And <span class="person">Solomon </span>reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of <span class="place">Egypt</span>: they brought presents, and served <span class="person">Solomon </span>all the days of his life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And <span class="person">Solomon</span>'s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And <span class="person">Judah </span>and <span class="place">Israel </span>dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from <span class="place">Dan </span>even to <span class="place">Beersheba</span>, all the days of <span class="person">Solomon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And <span class="person">Solomon </span>had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And those officers provided victual for king <span class="person">Solomon</span>, and for all that came unto king <span class="person">Solomon</span>'s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And God gave <span class="person">Solomon </span>wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>And <span class="person">Solomon</span>'s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of <span class="person">Solomon</span>, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
