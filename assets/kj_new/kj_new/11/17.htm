<h3>Chapter 17 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>And <span class="person">Elijah </span>the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of <span class="place">Gilead</span>, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel </span>liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before <span class="place">Jordan</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before <span class="place">Jordan</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And <span class="person">Elijah </span>said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>For thus saith the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And she went and did according to the saying of <span class="person">Elijah</span>: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by <span class="person">Elijah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>And she said unto <span class="person">Elijah</span>, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>And the LORD heard the voice of <span class="person">Elijah</span>; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>And <span class="person">Elijah </span>took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and <span class="person">Elijah </span>said, See, thy son liveth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And the woman said to <span class="person">Elijah</span>, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.
