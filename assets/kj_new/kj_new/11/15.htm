<!--... the Word of God:--><span class="dimver">   
</span>
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1 </span>Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over <span class="person">Judah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2 </span>Three years reigned he in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was <span class="person">Maachah</span>, the daughter of Abishalom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3 </span>And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of <span class="person">David </span>his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4 </span>Nevertheless for <span class="person">David</span>'s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, to set up his son after him, and to establish <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5 </span>Because <span class="person">David </span>did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6 </span>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7 </span>Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8 </span>And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of <span class="person">David</span>: and <span class="person">Asa </span>his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9 </span>And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of <span class="place">Israel </span>reigned <span class="person">Asa </span>over <span class="person">Judah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10 </span>And forty and one years reigned he in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was <span class="person">Maachah</span>, the daughter of Abishalom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11 </span>And <span class="person">Asa </span>did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did <span class="person">David </span>his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12 </span>And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13 </span>And also <span class="person">Maachah </span>his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and <span class="person">Asa </span>destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14 </span>But the high places were not removed: nevertheless <span class="person">Asa</span>'s heart was perfect with the LORD all his days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15 </span>And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16 </span>And there was war between <span class="person">Asa </span>and Baasha king of <span class="place">Israel </span>all their days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17 </span>And Baasha king of <span class="place">Israel </span>went up against <span class="person">Judah</span>, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to <span class="person">Asa </span>king of <span class="person">Judah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18 </span>Then <span class="person">Asa </span>took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king <span class="person">Asa </span>sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of <span class="place">Syria</span>, that dwelt at <span class="place">Damascus</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19 </span>There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, that he may depart from me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20 </span>So Benhadad hearkened unto king <span class="person">Asa</span>, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and smote Ijon, and <span class="place">Dan</span>, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of <span class="person">Naphtali</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21 </span>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22 </span>Then king <span class="person">Asa </span>made a proclamation throughout all <span class="person">Judah</span>; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king <span class="person">Asa </span>built with them Geba of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, and <span class="place">Mizpah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23 </span>The rest of all the acts of <span class="person">Asa</span>, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24 </span>And <span class="person">Asa </span>slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of <span class="person">David </span>his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25 </span>And <span class="person">Nadab </span>the son of Jeroboam began to reign over <span class="place">Israel </span>in the second year of <span class="person">Asa </span>king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and reigned over <span class="place">Israel </span>two years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26 </span>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made <span class="place">Israel </span>to sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27 </span>And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of <span class="person">Issachar</span>, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for <span class="person">Nadab </span>and all <span class="place">Israel </span>laid siege to Gibbethon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28 </span>Even in the third year of <span class="person">Asa </span>king of <span class="person">Judah </span>did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29 </span>And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30 </span>Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made <span class="place">Israel </span>sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel </span>to anger. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31 </span>Now the rest of the acts of <span class="person">Nadab</span>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32 </span>And there was war between <span class="person">Asa </span>and Baasha king of <span class="place">Israel </span>all their days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33 </span>In the third year of <span class="person">Asa </span>king of <span class="person">Judah </span>began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all <span class="place">Israel </span>in Tirzah, twenty and four years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34 </span>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made <span class="place">Israel </span>to sin.
